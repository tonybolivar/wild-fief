Laimbard "Karmeijzin Spaez" VanMarien, better known as Karmenspier (Ettish for Crimson Spear), was a legendary Warlock of [[Vhaimos]] and contemporary leader of the [[Black Army of Wudor]]. Born and groomed as an envoy to the Ecumenicum, he was given a temporary role as parish priest of Eikestad, just outside [[Margard]]. There, he watched and largely shared in the suffering of the local populace under the intermittent rule of the [[Kingdom of Valens]] and [[Republic of Ettmark]], the former of which instilled martial rule and brutally suppressed opposition, and the latter of which allowed hired mercenary bands to feed off the countryside brutally.
