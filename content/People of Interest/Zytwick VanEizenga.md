> A portrait of the Master Zytwick VanEizenga.

Zytwick "the Odd" VanEizenga was Bailiff of Castle Zotten during the [[Second Ettish War]], and retainer to the [[House Wyltshire]]. Despite his tenure being expected to last a mere few years, every member of the Wyltshire family during this time period was somehow murdered in a brutal fashion, leaving only infants and relatives-of-relatives as legitimate heirs to the position of Zotten's head. As a result, VanEizenga retained control of the castle until the end of the Second Ettish War.

A siege engineer trained by masters in Clarinne, VanEizenga oversaw the defense of [[Zotten]] during the [[Siege of Zotten]] against attacking forces of the [[Kingdom of Valens]]. Utilizing the marshy terrain and a well-placed network of ditches and spearwalls, his efforts allowed the defending Ettish army- comprised of mostly peasants and mercenaries- to dismount a large portion of the attacking Valenic heavy cavalry. Among the mercenaries were several wizards and mage-hunters, who were able to effectively utilize anti-magic countermeasures to deprive the charging cavalry of any support.

He is believed to have personally defeated Clement De Fleur by challenging him to a duel in single combat, losing horribly, and then casting Power Word: Kill.

He was brutally killed by Drow in 1309.
