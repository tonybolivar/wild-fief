Archebaud de Fleur, better known as the Onyx King, was ruler of the [[Kingdom of Valens]] throughout the late 1200s VD. Known as a cruel and uncompromising tyrant, he considerably accelerated the geographical expansion of the burgeoning Valenic Empire through rapid military conquest.

He was a direct descendant of [[Aucen de Fleur]].



In the mid-1400s VD, it was considered taboo to speak his name. Widespread knowledge of the Onyx King's name and title were only popularized after the end of the [[Second Ettish War]].
