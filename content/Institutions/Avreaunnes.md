The **Avreaunnes** (Ett. "Vreeligers") were followers of the Ettish heretic Gessel Vrelhe. Believing the state institutions of the [[Second Shining Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Valens]] were corrupting the innately community and personal-truth based historical understanding of the Myriad, they called for the end of clerical interference in civil matters, the granting of greater autonomy to local clerical figures in towns and villages, and the end of any and all inquisitions (in both state clerical and Ecumenical forms.) Their rise largely coincided with the Valenic usage of clerical institutions to encourage horizontal infighting between religious and plutocratic elements of the Kingdom's power base.

The Avreaunnes, as well as members of the [[Semenstral Church]], were violently persecuted under the reign of [[Archebaud de Fleur]]. Many would be deported to isolated border regions or simply killed.
