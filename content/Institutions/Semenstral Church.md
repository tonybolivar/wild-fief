The **Semenstral Church** is a Myraidic organization widely regarded as a heresy, endemic to large portions of Northern Wudor.

Semenstrals did not recognize the rise of Geffer to divinity, instead believing him to be either Avatar or Saint, and profess that the original design of the Myriad was and is the state which it shall through be forever incarnate.
