The Ecumenical Church of the Seven, often known as the **Ecumenicum,** is an international institution recognized by the majority of [[Wudor]] as the sole and final authority on all matters regarding [[The Myriad]] in earthly affairs.

The Ecumenicum split from the [[Almighty Hieronate of the Seven]] over the position of the Almighty Hieron and the notion of clerical leadership. While the Hieronate has a supreme authority, the Ecumenicum is conciliar, and their High Adherent does not claim to personally invoke the will of the Myriad in any way, shape, or form.
