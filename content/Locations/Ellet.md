Ellet (Ett: Aelitz) was a small town under the de jure domain of the the Duchy of [[Zotten]], control of which fluctuated during the [[Second Ettish War]]. 

> Early History

Aelitz was founded in 814 VD by Ettish settlers seeking to capitalize off increased trade between the newly unified [[Kingdom of Valens]] and the smaller polities to the north. Initially a small village with a few trading posts, unusually fertile soil owing to the nearby rivers allowed for more intensive agriculture to begin. Aelitz's population surpassed one-hundred and fifty in 1244 VD, and remained around this number for the rest of it's known history preceding the Second Ettish War.

> 1300s VD

In the early 1300s, a mostly bloodless takeover of the town occurred when the Valenic crown strong-armed the Duchy of Zotten into accepting border adjustments. The direct relationship between Ellet and Zotten was fairly weak for a lordship and it's vassal-by-technicality, and few of Ellet's elders actually paid any taxes to the Duke of Zotten, leading the Zotteners to begrudgingly accept.

At the outbreak of the Onyx King's wars, Ellet lay firmly under Valenic control, and was repeatedly used for supplies and quartering. During this time, traditional Ettish laws for the choosing of Elders were discontinued in favor of selection by Valenic authorities, and the town was officially renamed Ellet.
