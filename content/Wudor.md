Wudor is one of the several continents in Wild Fief. It is the continent where the [[Second Ettish War]], and thus the events of the first two Wild Fief roleplays, occur.

It is bordered by the continent of Quzarat to the southeast, the Sea of the Desolation to the west, and the Cyning's Sea to the north.

Wudor can be roughly divided into five regions.

Central Wudor is where the central events of Wild Fief are set, and where the [[Republic of Ettmark]] revolted against the [[Kingdom of Valens]] during the Second Ettish War. 

[[Western Wudor]], where the [[Teurechti People]] Second Shining Empire holds political dominance over a myriad of smaller constituent polities.

Southern Wudor, or Ancandore, inhabited by the [[Carettic People]] and home to the Ecumenicum, recognized across the Myriad's domain as the birthplace of the Myriad and the supreme religious authority on the continent. In the east, portions of the region are occupied by the [[Quzarat]]-based Elven [[Evershining Empire]].

Eastern Wudor, where the Greater and Lesser Koy feud with invading Orcish hordes.

Northern Wudor, where the [[Realm of Velmir]] is resplendant.

Almost all inhabitants of Wudor are worshippers of the Myriad, with the exception of small portions in the southeast currently occupied by the Evershining Empire.
