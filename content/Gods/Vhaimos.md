Vhaimos, The Great Deceiver, was the god of Chaos, Entropy, and Deception in traditional Myriadic interpretation. Borne of the death of [[Voadn]] alongside the other gods of the Accord, she sought to cause immeasurable chaos throughout the world in order to introduce sufficient entropy to stop the world from becoming complacent.

Her, [Keret] and [Zuruk] formed the Wretched Accord, the union between Chaos, Death, and Destruction to dethrone the Myriad. 

Not all worshippers of Vhaimos were evil

She was known to be the archenemy of [Hteros]- where she stands for change and fluidity, Hteros stands for strength and rigidity.
