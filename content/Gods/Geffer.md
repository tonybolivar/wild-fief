**Geffer** was an avatar of [[Tyr]] who ascended to godhood after resisting his demonic torturers for an exceptional amount of time. However, through his suffering he unlocked strength, and endured for fourty-seven weeks in agony as the demons used all varieties of methods to extract the knowledge of his people's location from him.

For his devotion to the Myriad in life and near-death, he was granted godhood by unanimous decision of the other six members of [[The Myriad]]. After joining the Myriad, he became the Avatar of Resilience.

He was the favored of the seven gods among the psuedo-religious peasant revolt known as the [[Black Army of Wudor]].
