Hteros, the Binded Chain, is the god of Subjugation, Tyranny, and Slavery.

The Evershining Empire worshipped Hteros with a warped perception, believing him the patron god of rigidity and stability. This strength, along with the light of the Evershining Elves, is what they believed granted the Empire it's eternal nature.

While an evil god, not all Hteros worshippers are wicked- many simply believe that a firm hand is necessary to maintain public good and order. Several paladins and clerics had shown themselves to be blessed by Hteros and complicit in his will despite their noble actions and intentions.-
