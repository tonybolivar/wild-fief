*To serve you is to reign.* 
> Motto of the [[Cult of the Lunar Wind]].

Kenway Moonsail (Vlm: Kenvaeg) was the God of Ambition. Once a legendary adventurer (see [[Kenway Moonsail (Person)]]) from the [[Realm of Velmir]], the death of his father to Valenic naval forces compelled him to take destiny into his own hands, and enable others to do so once ascended to Godhood.

Standing for all who would rise above their circumstances and shape the world around them to their choosing, the worshippers of Kenway Moonsail are nothing if not adamant- they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals, and believe the ends justify the means by any means necessary. While not evil by typical means, and usually possessing just goals, worshippers of Kenway Moonsail are unique in that they hold no moral compromise too grand in achieving their greater vision.

Kenway's introduction into the Myriadic pantheon was a major factor in the fracture of Myriadic dominance over the region, as Wudorians now had a God that would empower mortals largely based on how fervently they pursued their cause. Whether for vengeance against injustice, a vision of how the world should be, or rising above one's circumstance, those who showed the greatest ambition and were willing to go the furthest physical and moral lengths to achieve it were granted Moonsail's blessing.
