Voadn, Hierarch of the Living Realm, was the primordial god of nature, the Fey Realm, and life itself. He usurped and betrayed his mother [[Miasha]] in order to acheive this, but was slain by his sister Vinhema.

Both Voadn and Vinhema gave their lives up in their fight against each other, but their essence persisted in the [Wretched Accord] and [The Myriad], respectively.

Voadn's essence would shatter into [[Zuul'galak]], [[Hteros]],  [[Jhul'zurjin]], and [[Zuruk]].
