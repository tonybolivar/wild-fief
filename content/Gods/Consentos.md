Consentos was the first God in Myriadic theology, who rose the continent of [[Wudor]] from the depths of the ocean and granted it as the sole domain of Humanity and Elvendom in a world where the uncivilized races slaughtered humanity in droves.

He gave his life to grant godhood to his favored daughter, [[Miasha]].

Later theology rejects the notion that Consentos created Wudor solely for Humanity and Elvendom, as the former did not yet exist. Contemporary belief is that the realm was created for all civil, peace-loving races, the umbrella for which is debated among many.
