The Myriad a union of seven gods [[Gefion]], [[Narthei]], [[Tyr]], [[Geffer]], all born from the death of [[Vinhema]]


After the surmised death of Tyr by the hand of Kenway Moonsail, the faith experienced a schism, splitting into the [[Ecumenical Church of the Seven]], or Curedians, who favored the introduction of Keret into the Myriad in the dead god Tyr's stead, and the [[Almighty Hieronate of the Seven]], or Tyrrans, who believed that Tyr had merely been mortally wounded or harmed by the events, and that sufficient faith and effort could reawaken him.

They are archenemies of the [[Wretched Accord]].
