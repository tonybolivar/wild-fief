Hearth-sonning was an ancient tradition of the [[Auceni]] barbarian peoples, in which the first daughter of each clansman would be raised as male from birth, later gaining the legal status of a male upon reaching adulthood.

While curtailed during the centralization of the [[Kingdom of Valens]] into a singular realm, the policy was eventually revived following the [[Carettic War]] in order to provide the struggling nobility with a means to replenish their ranks and prevent collapse of the state due to lack of available levies. The subsequent explosion in landless lower nobility as a result of this policy is known as [[The Aînement]].
