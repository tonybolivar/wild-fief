A Mana Trade is a component of a [[Mana Skirmish]] referring to the amount of expended mana by each side.

In smaller-scale terms, a positive mana trade would be utilizing Counterspell to stop Wall of Fire- more mana was exerted by the opponent than the caster.

In larger scale terms, it refers to the 'success' of individual phases in a greater Mana Skirmish.
