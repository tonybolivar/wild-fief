**Valenards**, or Valenics (Vln: Valenards, 'Valenics') are a nation and ethno-racial grouping indigenous to [[Central Wudor]], and the dominant ethnic group within the [[Kingdom of Valens]].

> Etymology

"Valenic" originated as the Elven exonym "Gans Falenaei / "People of the Boundaries" from the [[First Shining Empire]] to refer to the grouping of barbaric [[Humans]] that had arrived in the Empire's northeastern frontier from farther eastwards. The differing proto-Valenic clans that arrived in the region would take great cultural influence from the Elves and Humans living in the Shining Empire, adopting their methods of government and worship of the Myriad. 

The [[Kingdom of Valens]] was originally called the "Kingdom of the Valens" or "Kingdom of the Valeni," with 'Valens' taken as a Valenization once [[Aucen de Fleur]] unified the region. He did this primarily to create a basis for the greater realm of all Central Wudorian peoples he wished to form, though the contemporary understanding of the term would consist of the Valeni (later deemed Valenards), Clarinnete, Vourgnards, Naiseaunians, and Cainards.


> In Valens

Historically, the heritage of the Valenic People is derived partially from the First Shining Empire. 

> Outside Valens

Many Valenards fled Wudor for a variety of reasons after the Desolation was discovered, including the remainder of the disgraced De Fleur family, who would found Fleurica on the southern coast.

Inland, the Valenic colony of Aviennaria would be formed in 1522, utilizing a newfound southern coast and collaboration with Carettic traders. In 1586, prolonged loss of contact due to unknown phenomena regarding the Desolate Sea prompted the Aviennards to rise up against remaining Valenic authorities, forming the Republic of Aviennaria.
