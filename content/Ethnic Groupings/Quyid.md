> Zaman Ei-Qazali, Quyid Paladin of Hteros active in Wudor 1484-1492

Quyid is a general term to describe both the Asharadi and Qayyid ethnic groups, as well as any non-Wudorian non-Elven ethnic groups under the [[Evershining Empire]] active in Wudor. These are primarily humans native to Quzarat.

While a rare sight in Wudor, they occasionally appear as foot soldiers and specialists in service of the Evershining Empire. Many are Myriadic worshippers forcefully converted towards the sole worship of Hteros common in the Evershining Empire, while others hold a true and genuine belief in the chained God as the paragon of stability and goodness.
