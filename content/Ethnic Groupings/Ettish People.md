The Ettish (Ett: Ettiske, Vln: Ette) are a Middle Skaelic nation primarily located in Northern-Central Wudor. The Etts are primarily descended from the expansion of other Middle Skaelic peoples during the later period of the First Shining Empire onto the largely depopulated northern coast. They were removed from the region of Kalward (now known as [[Galvar]]) by migration from the [[Valenard People]], part of the invading [[Auceni]] barbarians fleeing the [[Forest Orcs]].
