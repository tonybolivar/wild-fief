The **Evershining Elves** (Ael: Dah'ros), or **Drow** in Wudorian texts, are a subgrouping of Elves indigenous to [[Quzarat]] that worshipped the Evershining Flame of Nacheviyan. They are ancestors of the progenitor [[Elves]] that created the First Shining Empire, and the dominant ethnic group in the [[Evershining Empire]] that claims it's mantle.

The contemporary name for the domain inhabited by the Drow is 'Aelvizdan,' a conjugate of Old Elvish "Aelfe" into "Aelv", and the Qayyid term "-iz'dan," meaning "land of."
