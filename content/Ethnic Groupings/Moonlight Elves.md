The **Moonlight Elves** (Valaidseag) are a sub-grouping of Forest Elves indigenous to the coniferous woods of [[Western Wudor]]. Identifiable by their white or blue hair, and their blue or purple eyes, the Moonlight Elves can be further divided into the Wolfsworn Elves, who have (willingly or not) been incorporated into the Western Shining Empire, and the Moonheart Elves, who organize themselves into tribal polities outside of Human control.

As Forest Elves, they are distant relatives of the [[Vulgar Elves]].
