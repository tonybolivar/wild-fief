> A grove elf from western Ettmark.

The Vulgar Elves (Elv: Caidheanseag) are a sub-grouping of forest elves indigenous to the forests of what is now Valens and Ettmark, displaced by the movement of the Valenard people in the west. Locked in a near-eternal conflict with the [[Forest Orcs]], Vulgar Elves were largely able to assimilate into Valenard and Ettish society within the last three-hundred years, and their independent communities are for the most part respected by the authorities of both Ettmark and Valens.

Practicing a tribalistic variant of modern Wudorian understandings of Druidism, Vulgar Elves are for the most part vehemently opposed to the various human druid cults that have arisen in support of Voadn, believing it a gross violation of the natural order.
