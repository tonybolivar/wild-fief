The Forest Orcs (Oks: Ghoz'katug) are the indigenous inhabitants of the woods of central Wudor, alongside the [[Little Fey]] and [[Vulgar Elves]], the latter of which they have been engaged in near-constant warfare against since time immemorial.

Unlike the organized hordes to the east, the Forest Orcs possess pale teal skin and organize themselves into smaller clans. Having shifted their war against Elvendom to the invading humans, the Forest Orcs have utilized their knowledge of the Fey-infested woods west of the Valenic core to wage a prolonged campaign against Human incursions into their land.

While still worshippers of Jhul'zurjin, their interpretation of the matter is far different from the Horde Orcs to the east, and is much more primal, often sparking inquiries into whether the actions of the primordial Goddess [[Miasha]] may have had more influence on them than [[Jhul'zurjin]] or his father, [[Voadn]].

Their worship involves a deeply territorial culture and society, where humanity is at fault for incurring on their territory solely because they are the hunting and grazing grounds that *belong* to the Forest Orcs.
