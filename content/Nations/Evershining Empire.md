The Evershining Empire, internally referred to as simply the **Domain of the Evershining Flame** (Elv. "Kdasí Aiona Elefos, or simply Aiona Elefos ), was a polity in Quzarat comprised of [[Evershining Elves]] and [[Quyid]] peoples, the former of which claimed continuity with the [[First Shining Empire]]. Having broken free from the ever-enticing glint of the Sacred Flame of Nacheviyan, the Evershining Elves shackled the eternal flame and offered it up to [[Hteros]] as a symbol of their devotion. Hteros would cure the afflicted Elves of their magical addiction for their offer, but their scorched skin from gazing at the flame all their lives would never pass.
