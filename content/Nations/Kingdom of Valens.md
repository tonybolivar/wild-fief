The Kingdom of Valens (Vln: Royame Valenaire / Shn: Regnum Valenae) was the largest and traditionally dominant state in Central Wudor. Born of the Valenais people who migrated into the region fleeing Orcish invasion in 689 VD, the Valenic fiefdoms were quickly unified by Aucen I de Fleur of Galvar in 788 VD.

Remaining a dominant power in the region, Valens competed with the Western Shining Empire for control over the Ettish fiefdoms.
