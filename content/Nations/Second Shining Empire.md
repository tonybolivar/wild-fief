The **Enkindled Realm**, or Second Shining Empire (Trcht: Reich des Leuchtes, lit. 'Lit Realm') was a [[Teurechti People]] polity that, alongside the Drow [[Evershining Empire]], claimed to be a direct successor of the Pan-Wudorian High Elven [[First Shining Empire]]. 

Claiming direct continuity with the Myriadic institutions that ran the first realm, the Enkindled Realm remains a theocratic polity politically dominated by [[Elves]] and [[Teurechti People]], despite possessing a sizable [[Ettish People]] minority and a small portion of [[Valenard People]] and [[Carettic People]] within it's borders.
