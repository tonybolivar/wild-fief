It was a direct successor of the [[Free Republic of Margard]].

> Background

Having suffered from a complete lack of internal stability for years in the immediate aftermath of the [[Onyx King's War]], the [[Kingdom of Valens]] demanded increasingly large sums of grain, manpower, and wealth in order to fuel it's additional conquests. As one of the least developed parts of [[Central Wudor]], ethnic [[Ettish People]] areas were hit especially hard by these demands, and often had their local governments sidelined if they could not provide adequate resources to the Valenic crown.

As a result, peasants in and around the Valenic-Ettish border were deeply hostile towards the Valenic soldiery, tax collectors, and representatives of the Valenic crown sent to replace local Ettish rulers after they repeatedly failed to deliver sufficient results. Attempts to evict these groups from their lands began as early as a year into the Onyx King's conquests, though they would be swiftly and brutally vanquished by the armies of local Valenic nobility, and often, Ettish middlemen, or [[Valkoons]], utilizing personal levies and mercenaries to retain their titles. Such hostilities are a large part of why the Black Army would remain hostile to the [[Republic of Ettmark]] once Ettish gentry revolted against the Valenic crown.

While plans to decisively deal with the peasant issue through increased oversight of the activity of local nobility were being drafted, the Valenic Queen-Regency in the immediate aftermath of the death of the Onyx King [[Archebaud de Fleur]] was far more concerned with both revolting Ettish gentry and an opportunistic invasion of Valenic Carettia by the [[Evershining Empire]] in what would be known as the [[Carettic War]]. This neglect of the peasantry eventually saw several sporadic peasant uprisings in and around Margard, which would completely overturn the ruling Aucennard family.

The composition of Black Army forces was deeply unstandardized and drew mainly from anyone who had a grievance of sorts with either Valens or Ettmark- while the majority of Black Army forces derived from peasants or townsmen, those with other outstanding hatreds towards either side of the Second Ettish War joined their ranks.

Among these were Myriadic devotees who believed that certain laws, including various incursions of Valenic and Ettish highborne on the common land of their respective peasantry. Believing such incursions, and in some cases the practice of serfdom in it's entirety,
