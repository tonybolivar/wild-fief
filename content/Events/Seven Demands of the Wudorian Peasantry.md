``HARKEN YE LORDS AND MASTERS OF THE VALENIC AND ETTISH REALM, AUTHORITIES BOTH ECCLACELESTIAL AND LAY``

``Twenty three years we have suffered tyranny from the godless and criminal nobility and gentry of thine realms, and followed without question the commandment of Geffer, to remain loving, peaceful and harmonious even throughout suffering most unjust. Twenty three years we have toiled in duty to these same lords, who by divine commandment of Narthei were obligated to protect, feed, and house their servants.``

``Even through such, clear it has become that the leadership of your domains have abandoned the commandments of the Myriad, seeking only wealth and decadent sin in pursuit of greater affluence and the means to wage reckless war.``

``The arch-lords of Valens at their leisure dismiss and persecute the free believers and preachers of the Myriad, replacing them with their own servants and compelling them to spew lies most vile to confound TRUE worshippers. The gentry of Ettmark fatten their pockets, and eat and drink for one-hundred men each, while those from whom they take wealth and tax suffer. The mercenaries and brigands hired by the vile Consulate lay idle in their towers, while the realm suffers from banditry and pillaging, for the Raat de Drei is concerned only with protecting the masses of wealth they have accumulated through theft from the common man.``

``Truly, heathenry has descended upon the leadership of Wudor, for there is no peace, and all under heaven is in chaos.``

``NO MORE WILL WE SUFFER THIS HERESY``

``Henceforth we will return not to the fields and work in harmony lest sufficient action be taken to align the conduct of the noblemen and gentry with the teachings of the Myriad. Failing this, it is clear by divine commandment that the understanding of Myriadic teachings by the crowns of Valens and Ettmark have been incorrigibly corrupted, as they are incapable of seeing past their numerous sins to begin towards the path to forgiveness. To this end, we have contacted experts most revered to analyze without passion or biased intent the corruption and flaws in the conduct of such groups, and procure instructions on how the favor of the Seven can be regained by your realms,``

``1. The noble estates of the realm shall recede the right to harm or dismiss the preacher of any town or village without the written approval of relevant clerical authorities. Any that have prior been dismissed for preaching the word of the Myriad clearly without human additions will be allowed to return to their positions, and the false preachers sent by the estates of the realm without knowledge of the Myriad's will made to step down.``

``2. It is Unmyriadic that the nobility and gentry have taken sole possession of the forest, which is an extension of the domain of the common land of the village or hamlet, not the property or territory of the highborne of the realm. The Lord Consentos created the realm for Man and granted him dominion over the land and seas, without regard for status of nobility.``

``3. The excessive compulsory labor demanded of us, which grows each day without end, shall be reduced to an amount that begets the necessary time for the labor of the fields.``

``4. If the noblefolk of the land wish still to invoke compulsory labor, then the estate tax must be accordingly reduced to take into account the days that men were not permitted to return to the fields and work.``

``5. The compulsory conscription of soldiery beyond one individual per each household shall end, for it is shameful to force women and children alone to labor in the fields as their husbands are slaughtered by the dozens in war. Tyr himself said the uninvolved need not suffer the consequence of wars waged by their masters, which many during this great conflict have as even the womenfolk have turned to sellswordry.``

``6. The death-tax shall be abolished in it's entirely, and no more shall the widows and children of men who have without question served the realm be robbed and sullied of honor, as to take from the meek and dead is revulsive and vile.``

``7. It was said that each man was borne free upon this earth when Consentos gave this land to us and created the Myriad to protect us from influences vile and evil, and to guide each man into moral action and conduct, that he may be reunited with the Great God in the heavens. To restrict a man and make him unfree is a crime against the very nature of the Myriad, and should not be suffered under the domain of the righteous.``

``We declare that we are free and wish to remain so.``

``Hear us and adhere if you listen with the ear of intelligence.``
