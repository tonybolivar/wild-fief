The **Torching of Vyltwick** was the controlled burning of the majority of the fields in the County of Vyltwick, where Castle [[Zotten]] lay. Artain I of Valens ordered the burnings, hoping to deny resources to local Ettish forces and flood the castle with refugees it could not possibly hope to feed and house.

The burnings would have a massive effect on the region's economy, leading to the collapse of order in the countryside even after the [[Siege of Zotten]] had ended. Some surmise that the burnings were a poor idea, as they significantly discredited the pro-Valenic [[Valkoons]] in the region and led to a large portion of the afflicted refugees swearing fealty and service to the [[Republic of Ettmark]], subsequently participating in the defense of the Castle as militia.
